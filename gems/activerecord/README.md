Maintenance policy for RBS of Rails
===

We basically only accept changes for the versions listed under the **"List of currently supported releases"** in the [Rails' maintenance policy](https://rubyonrails.org/maintenance).

Versions outside of that are generally not accepted for changes. We do not run tests for them, nor do we include them in format detection.

This is a measure to reduce maintenance costs.

If you have any questions, please contact the maintainers. Refer to `_reviewers.yaml` for the list of maintainers.
