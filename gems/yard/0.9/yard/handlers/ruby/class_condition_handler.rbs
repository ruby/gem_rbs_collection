# @example A simple class conditional
#   class Foo
#     if 0
#       # This method is ignored
#       def xyz; end
#     end
#   end

  # Parses the condition part of the if/unless statement
  #
  # @return [true, false, nil] true if the condition can be definitely
  #   parsed to true, false if not, and nil if the condition cannot be
  #   parsed with certainty (it's dynamic)
