  # @return [Boolean] whether or not a {Parser::Ruby::Legacy::Statement} object should be handled

  # Parses a statement's block with a set of state values. If the

  private def extract_method_details: () -> Array[String | Array[Array[String]]]
  # The string value of a token. For example, the return value for the symbol :sym
  # would be :sym. The return value for a string +"foo #{ bar}"+ would be the literal
  # +"foo #{ bar}"+ without any interpolation. The return value of the identifier
  # 'test' would be the same value: 'test'. Here is a list of common types and
  # their return values:
  #
  # @example
  #   tokval(TokenList.new('"foo"').first) => "foo"
  #   tokval(TokenList.new(':foo').first) => :foo
  #   tokval(TokenList.new('CONSTANT').first, RubyToken::TkId) => "CONSTANT"
  #   tokval(TokenList.new('identifier').first, RubyToken::TkId) => "identifier"
  #   tokval(TokenList.new('3.25').first) => 3.25
  #   tokval(TokenList.new('/xyz/i').first) => /xyz/i
  #
  # @param [Token] token The token of the class
  #
  # @param [Array<Class<Token>>, Symbol] accepted_types
  #   The allowed token types that this token can be. Defaults to [{TkVal}].
  #   A list of types would be, for example, [+TkSTRING+, +TkSYMBOL+], to return
  #   the token's value if it is either of those types. If +TkVal+ is accepted,
  #   +TkNode+ is also accepted.
  #
  #   Certain symbol keys are allowed to specify multiple types in one fell swoop.
  #   These symbols are:
  #     :string       => +TkSTRING+, +TkDSTRING+, +TkDXSTRING+ and +TkXSTRING+
  #     :attr         => +TkSYMBOL+ and +TkSTRING+
  #     :identifier   => +TkIDENTIFIER, +TkFID+ and +TkGVAR+.
  #     :number       => +TkFLOAT+, +TkINTEGER+
  #
  # @return [Object] if the token is one of the accepted types, in its real value form.
  #   It should be noted that identifiers and constants are kept in String form.
  # @return [nil] if the token is not any of the specified accepted types
  private def tokval: (untyped token, *Array[untyped] | Symbol accepted_types) -> untyped
  # Returns a list of symbols or string values from a statement.
  # The list must be a valid comma delimited list, and values
  # will only be returned to the end of the list only.
  #
  # Example:
  #   attr_accessor :a, 'b', :c, :d => ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
  #   attr_accessor 'a', UNACCEPTED_TYPE, 'c' => ['a', 'c']
  #
  # The tokval list of a {Parser::Ruby::Legacy::TokenList} of the above
  # code would be the {#tokval} value of :a, 'b',
  # :c and :d.
  #
  # It should also be noted that this function stops immediately at
  # any ruby keyword encountered:
  #   "attr_accessor :a, :b, :c if x == 5"  => ['a', 'b', 'c']
  #
  # @param [TokenList] tokenlist The list of tokens to process.
  # @param [Array<Class<Token>>] accepted_types passed to {#tokval}
  # @return [Array<String>] the list of tokvalues in the list.
  # @return [Array<EMPTY>] if there are no symbols or Strings in the list
  # @see #tokval
