  # @!method process
  # Main processing callback
  # @return [void]
  def process: () -> void
  # @overload process_decorator(*nodes, opts = {}, &block)
  #   Takes care of parsing method definitions passed to decorators
  #   as parameters, as well as parsing chained decorators.
  #
  #   Use this in a handler's process block.
  #
  #   @yieldparam method [YARD::CodeObjects::MethodObject] Method being decorated.
  #   @yieldparam node [YARD::Parser::Ruby::AstNode] AST node of the decorated method.
  #   @yieldparam name [Symbol] Name of the decorated method.
  #   @return [Array<Hash>] Array of hashes containing :method, :node, :name.
  #     See yield params.
  #
  #   @param nodes [YARD::Parser::Ruby::AstNode] AST nodes that refer to decorated
  #     methods, like indexes of statement.parameter. Defaults to all parameters.
  #     Pass nil to specify zero parameters.
  #
  #   @option opts [:instance, :class] :scope (:instance) Scope to use for each
  #     MethodObject.
  #
  #   @option opts [true, false] :transfer_docstring Set false to disable
  #     transferring the decorator docstring to method definitions passed to the
  #     decorator as parameters.
  #
  #   @option opts [true, false] :transfer_source Set false to disable
  #     transferring the decorator source code string to method definitions
  #     passed to the decorator as parameters.
  #
  #   @example Basic Usage
  #     # Simply pass the method docs through to the method definition.
  #     process do
  #       process_decorator
  #     end
  #
  #   @example Setting a method's visibility to private.
  #     process do
  #       process_decorator :scope => :class do |method|
  #         method.visibility = :private if method.respond_to? :visibility
  #       end
  #     end
