# !!! GENERATED FILE !!!
# Please see generators/yard-generator/README.md

# Yardoc is the default YARD CLI command (+yard doc+ and historic +yardoc+
# executable) used to generate and output (mainly) HTML documentation given
# a set of source files.
#
# == Usage
#
# Main usage for this command is:
#
#   $ yardoc [options] [source_files [- extra_files]]
#
# See +yardoc --help+ for details on valid options.
#
# == Options File (+.yardopts+)
#
# If a +.yardopts+ file is found in the source directory being processed,
# YARD will use the contents of the file as arguments to the command,
# treating newlines as spaces. You can use shell-style quotations to
# group space delimited arguments, just like on the command line.
#
# A valid +.yardopts+ file might look like:
#
#   --no-private
#   --title "My Title"
#   --exclude foo --exclude bar
#   lib/**/*.erb
#   lib/**/*.rb -
#   HACKING.rdoc LEGAL COPYRIGHT
#
# Note that Yardoc also supports the legacy RDoc style +.document+ file,
# though this file can only specify source globs to parse, not options.
#
# == Queries (+--query+)
#
# Yardoc supports queries to select specific code objects for which to
# generate documentation. For example, you might want to generate
# documentation only for your public API. If you've documented your public
# methods with +@api public+, you can use the following query to select
# all of these objects:
#
#   --query '@api.text == "public"'
#
# Note that the syntax for queries is mostly Ruby with a few syntactic
# simplifications for meta-data tags. See the {Verifier} class for an
# overview of this syntax.
#
# == Adding Custom Ad-Hoc Meta-data Tags (+--tag+)
#
# YARD allows specification of {file:docs/Tags.md meta-data tags}
# programmatically via the {YARD::Tags::Library} class, but often this is not
# practical for users writing documentation. To make adding custom tags
# easier, Yardoc has a few command-line switches for creating basic tags
# and displaying them in generated HTML output.
#
# To specify a custom tag to be displayed in output, use any of the
# following:
#
# * +--tag+ TAG:TITLE
# * +--name-tag+ TAG:TITLE
# * +--type-tag+ TAG:TITLE
# * +--type-name-tag+ TAG:TITLE
# * +--title-tag+ TAG:TITLE
#
# "TAG:TITLE" is of the form: name:"Display Title", for example:
#
#   --tag overload:"Overloaded Method"
#
# See +yard help doc+ for a description of the various options.
#
# Tags added in this way are automatically displayed in output. To add
# a meta-data tag that does not show up in output, use +--hide-tag TAG+.
# Note that you can also use this option on existing tags to hide
# builtin tags, for instance.
#
# == Processed Data Storage (+.yardoc+ directory)
#
# When Yardoc parses a source directory, it creates a +.yardoc+ directory
# (by default, override with +-b+) at the root of the project. This directory
# contains marshal dumps for all raw object data in the source, so that
# you can access it later for various commands (+stats+, +graph+, etc.).
# This directory is also used as a cache for any future calls to +yardoc+
# so as to process only the files which have changed since the last call.
#
# When Yardoc uses the cache in subsequent calls to +yardoc+, methods
# or classes that have been deleted from source since the last parsing
# will not be erased from the cache (YARD never deletes objects). In such
# a case, you should wipe the cache and do a clean parsing of the source tree.
# You can do this by deleting the +.yardoc+ directory manually, or running
# Yardoc without +--use-cache+ (+-c+).
