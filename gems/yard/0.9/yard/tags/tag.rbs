# Represents a metadata tag value (+@tag+). Tags can have any combination of
# {#types}, {#name} and {#text}, or none of the above.
#
# @example Programmatic tag creation
#   # The following docstring syntax:
#   #   @param [String, nil] arg an argument
#   #
#   # is equivalent to:
#   Tag.new(:param, 'an argument', ['String', 'nil'], 'arg')
class YARD::Tags::Tag
  # @return [String] the name of the tag
  attr_accessor tag_name: String
  # @return [String] the tag text associated with the tag
  # @return [nil] if no tag text is supplied
  attr_accessor text: String?
  # @return [Array<String>] a list of types associated with the tag
  # @return [nil] if no types are associated with the tag
  attr_accessor types: Array[String]?
  # @return [String] a name associated with the tag
  attr_accessor name: String
  # @return [CodeObjects::Base] the associated object
  attr_accessor object: YARD::CodeObjects::Base
  # Creates a new tag object with a tag name and text. Optionally, formally declared types
  # and a key name can be specified.
  #
  # Types are mainly for meta tags that rely on type information, such as +param+, +return+, etc.
  #
  # Key names are for tags that declare meta data for a specific key or name, such as +param+,
  # +raise+, etc.
  #
  # @param [#to_s] tag_name        the tag name to create the tag for
  # @param [String] text           the descriptive text for this tag
  # @param [Array<String>] types   optional type list of formally declared types
  #                                for the tag
  # @param [String] name           optional key name which the tag refers to
  def initialize: (untyped tag_name, String text, ?Array[String] types, ?String name) -> void
  # Convenience method to access the first type specified. This should mainly
  # be used for tags that only specify one type.
  #
  # @return [String] the first of the list of specified types
  # @see #types
  def type: () -> String
  # Provides a plain English summary of the type specification, or nil
  # if no types are provided or parseable.
  #
  # @return [String] a plain English description of the associated types
  # @return [nil] if no types are provided or not parseable
