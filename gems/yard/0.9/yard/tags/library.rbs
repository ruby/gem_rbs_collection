# !!! GENERATED FILE !!!
# Please see generators/yard-generator/README.md

# Keeps track of all the registered meta-data tags and directives.
# Also allows for defining of custom tags and customizing the tag parsing
# syntax.
#
# == Defining Custom Meta-Data Tags
#
# To define a custom tag, use {define_tag}. You should pass the tag
# name and the factory method to use when creating the tag. If you do not
# provide a factory method to use, it will default to {DefaultFactory#parse_tag}
#
# You can also define tag objects manually by simply implementing a "tagname_tag"
# method that returns a {Tag} object, but they will not take advantage of tag factory
# parsing:
#
#   def mytag_tag(text)
#     Tag.new(:mytag, text)
#   end
#
# == Defining Custom Directives
#
# Directives can be defined by calling the {define_directive} method, taking
# the directive name, an optional tag factory parser method (to parse the
# data in the directive into a temporary {Tag} object) and a {Directive} subclass
# that performs the directive processing. For more information on creating a
# Directive subclass, see the {Directive} class documentation.
#
# Similar to tags, Directives can also be defined manually, in this case using
# the method name "mydirective_directive" and returning a new {Directive} object:
#
#   def mydirective_directive(tag, parser)
#     MyDirective.new(tag, parser)
#   end
#
# == Namespaced Tags
#
# In YARD 0.8.0+, tags can be namespaced using the '.' character. It is recommended
# to namespace project specific tags, like +@yard.tag_name+, so that tags do not
# collide with other plugins or new built-in tags.
#
# == Adding/Changing the Tag Syntax
#
# If you have specialized tag parsing needs you can substitute the {#factory}
# object with your own by setting {Library.default_factory= Library.default_factory}
# to a new class with its own parsing methods before running YARD. This is useful
# if you want to change the syntax of existing tags (@see, @since, etc.)
#
# @example Defining a custom tag
#   define_tag "Parameter", :param, :with_types_and_name
#   define_tag "Author", :author
# @example Defining a custom directive
#   define_directive :method, :with_title_and_text, MethodDirective
# @see DefaultFactory
# @see define_tag
# @see define_directive
# @see Directive

  def self.labels: () -> SymbolHash
  # @!attribute instance
  # @return [Library] the main Library instance object.
  attr_accessor self.instance: YARD::Tags::Library
  # @!attribute default_factory
  # Replace the factory object responsible for parsing tags by setting
  # this to an object (or class) that responds to +parse_TAGNAME+ methods
  # where +TAGNAME+ is the name of the tag.
  #
  # You should set this value before performing any source parsing with
  # YARD, otherwise your factory class will not be used.
  #
  # @example
  #   YARD::Tags::Library.default_factory = MyFactory
  #
  # @see DefaultFactory

  # the templates at specific positions:
