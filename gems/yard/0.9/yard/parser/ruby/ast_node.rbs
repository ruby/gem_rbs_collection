# An AST node is characterized by a type and a list of children. It
# is most easily represented by the s-expression {#s} such as:
#   # AST for "if true; 5 end":
#   s(s(:if, s(:var_ref, s(:kw, "true")), s(s(:int, "5")), nil))
#
# The node type is not considered part of the list, only its children.
# So +ast[0]+ does not refer to the type, but rather the first child
# (or object). Items that are not +AstNode+ objects can be part of the
# list, like Strings or Symbols representing names. To return only
# the AstNode children of the node, use {#children}.
