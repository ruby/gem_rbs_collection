# The Proxy class is a way to lazily resolve code objects in
# cases where the object may not yet exist. A proxy simply stores
# an unresolved path until a method is called on the object, at which
# point it does a lookup using {Registry.resolve}. If the object is
# not found, a warning is raised and {ProxyMethodError} might be raised.
#
# @example Creates a Proxy to the String class from a module
#   # When the String class is parsed this method will
#   # begin to act like the String ClassObject.
#   Proxy.new(mymoduleobj, "String")
# @see Registry.resolve
# @see ProxyMethodError
class YARD::CodeObjects::Proxy
  # Returns the value of attribute namespace.
  attr_reader namespace: untyped
  # Creates a new Proxy
  #
  # @raise [ArgumentError] if namespace is not a NamespaceObject
  # @return [Proxy] self

  # guesses at the correct path using the original namespace and name.

  # @return [String] the assumed path of the proxy (or the real path
  #   of the resolved object)
  def path: () -> String

  def equal?: (untyped other) -> bool

  # @return [Integer] the object's hash value (for equality checking)

  # resolved. Otherwise returns +Proxy+.
