# A MacroObject represents a docstring defined through +@!macro NAME+ and can be
# reused by specifying the tag +@!macro NAME+. You can also provide the
# +attached+ type flag to the macro definition to have it attached to the
# specific DSL method so it will be implicitly reused.
#
# Macros are fully described in the {file:docs/Tags.md#macro Tags Overview}
# document.
#
# @example Creating a basic named macro
#   # @!macro prop
#   #   @!method $1(${3-})
#   #   @return [$2] the value of the $0
#   property :foo, String, :a, :b
#
#   # @!macro prop
#   property :bar, Numeric, :value
#
# @example Creating a macro that is attached to the method call
#   # @!macro [attach] prop2
#   #   @!method $1(value)
#   property :foo
#
#   # Extra data added to docstring
#   property :bar

  #   attached to.

  # Creates a new macro and fills in the relevant properties.
  # @param [String] macro_name the name of the macro, must be unique.
  # @param [String] data the data the macro should expand when re-used
  # @param [CodeObjects::Base] method_object an object to attach this
  #   macro to. If supplied, {#attached?} will be true

  # with the [new] or [attached] flag, it is considered new.
  #
  # If a new macro is found, the macro is created and registered. Otherwise
  # the macro name is searched and returned. If a macro is not found,
  # nil is returned.
  #
  # @param [#to_s] macro_name the name of the macro
  # @param [CodeObjects::Base] method_object an optional method to attach
  #   the macro to. Only used if the macro is being created, otherwise
  #   this argument is ignored.
