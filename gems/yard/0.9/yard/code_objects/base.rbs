# +Base+ is the superclass of all code objects recognized by YARD. A code
# object is any entity in the Ruby language (class, method, module). A
# DSL might subclass +Base+ to create a new custom object representing
# a new entity type.
#
# == Registry Integration
# Any created object associated with a namespace is immediately registered
# with the registry. This allows the Registry to act as an identity map
# to ensure that no object is represented by more than one Ruby object
# in memory. A unique {#path} is essential for this identity map to work
# correctly.
#
# == Custom Attributes
# Code objects allow arbitrary custom attributes to be set using the
# {#[]=} assignment method.
#
# == Namespaces
# There is a special type of object called a "namespace". These are subclasses
# of the {NamespaceObject} and represent Ruby entities that can have
# objects defined within them. Classically these are modules and classes,
# though a DSL might create a custom {NamespaceObject} to describe a
# specific set of objects.
#
# == Separators
# Custom classes with different separator tokens should define their own
# separators using the {NamespaceMapper.register_separator} method. The
# standard Ruby separators have already been defined ('::', '#', '.', etc).
#
# @abstract This class should not be used directly. Instead, create a
#   subclass that implements {#path}, {#sep} or {#type}. You might also
#   need to register custom separators if {#sep} uses alternate separator
#   tokens.
