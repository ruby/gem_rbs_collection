# !!! GENERATED FILE !!!
# Please see generators/yard-generator/README.md

# The +PotGenerator+ generates POT format string from
# {CodeObjects::Base} and {CodeObjects::ExtraFileObject}.
#
# == POT and PO
#
# POT is an acronym for "Portable Object Template". POT is a
# template file to create PO file. The extension for POT is
# ".pot". PO file is an acronym for "Portable Object". PO file has
# many parts of message ID (msgid) that is translation target
# message and message string (msgstr) that is translated message
# of message ID. If you want to translate "Hello" in English into
# "Bonjour" in French, "Hello" is the msgid ID and "Bonjour" is
# msgstr. The extension for PO is ".po".
#
# == How to extract msgids
#
# The +PotGenerator+ has two parse methods:
#
# * {#parse_objects} for {CodeObjects::Base}
# * {#parse_files} for {CodeObjects::ExtraFileObject}
#
# {#parse_objects} extracts msgids from docstring and tags of
# {CodeObjects::Base} objects. The docstring of
# {CodeObjects::Base} object is parsed and a paragraph is
# extracted as a msgid. Tag name and tag text are extracted as
# msgids from a tag.
#
# {#parse_files} extracts msgids from
# {CodeObjects::ExtraFileObject} objects. The file content of
# {CodeObjects::ExtraFileObject} object is parsed and a paragraph
# is extracted as a msgid.
#
# == Usage
#
# To create a .pot file by +PotGenerator+, instantiate a
# +PotGenerator+ with a relative working directory path from a
# directory path that has created .pot file, parse
# {CodeObjects::Base} objects and {CodeObjects::ExtraFileObject}
# objects, generate a POT and write the generated POT to a .pot
# file. The relative working directory path is ".." when the
# working directory path is "."  and the POT is wrote into
# "po/yard.pot".
#
# @example Generate a .pot file
#   po_file_path = "po/yard.pot"
#   po_file_directory_pathname = Pathname.new(po_file_path).directory)
#   working_directory_pathname = Pathname.new(".")
#   relative_base_path = working_directory_pathname.relative_path_from(po_file_directory_pathname).to_s
#   # relative_base_path -> ".."
#   generator = YARD::I18n::PotGenerator.new(relative_base_path)
#   generator.parse_objects(objects)
#   generator.parse_files(files)
#   pot = generator.generate
#   po_file_directory_pathname.mkpath
#   File.open(po_file_path, "w") do |pot_file|
#     pot_file.print(pot)
#   end
