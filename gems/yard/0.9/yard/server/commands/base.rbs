# This is the base command class used to implement custom commands for
# a server. A command will be routed to by the {Router} class and return
# a Rack-style response.
#
# == Attribute Initializers
# All attributes can be initialized via options passed into the {#initialize}
# method. When creating a custom command, the {Adapter#options} will
# automatically be mapped to attributes by the same name on your class.
#
#   class MyCommand < Base
#     attr_accessor :myattr
#   end
#
#   Adapter.new(libs, {:myattr => 'foo'}).start
#
#   # when a request comes in, cmd.myattr == 'foo'
#
# == Subclassing Notes
# To implement a custom command, override the {#run} method, not {#call}.
# In your implementation, you should set the body and status for requests.
# See details in the +#run+ method documentation.
#
# Note that if your command deals directly with libraries, you should
# consider subclassing the more specific {LibraryCommand} class instead.
#
# @abstract
# @see #run
class YARD::Server::Commands::Base
  # @return [Hash] the options passed to the command's constructor
  attr_accessor command_options: Hash[untyped, untyped]
  # @return [Adapter] the server adapter
  attr_accessor adapter: YARD::Server::Adapter
  # @return [Boolean] whether to cache
  attr_accessor caching: bool
  # @return [Rack::Request] request object
  attr_accessor request: Rack::Request
  # @return [String] the path after the command base URI
  attr_accessor path: String
  # @return [Hash{String => String}] response headers
  attr_accessor headers: Hash[String, String]
  # @return [Numeric] status code. Defaults to 200 per request
  attr_accessor status: Numeric
  # @return [String] the response body. Defaults to empty string.
  attr_accessor body: String
  # Creates a new command object, setting attributes named by keys
  # in the options hash. After initialization, the options hash
  # is saved in {#command_options} for further inspection.
  #
  # @example Creating a Command
  #   cmd = DisplayObjectCommand.new(:caching => true, :library => mylib)
  #   cmd.library # => mylib
  #   cmd.command_options # => {:caching => true, :library => mylib}
  # @param [Hash] opts the options hash, saved to {#command_options}
  #   after initialization.
  def initialize: (?Hash[untyped, untyped] opts) -> void
  # The main method called by a router with a request object.
  #
  # @note This command should not be overridden by subclasses. Implement
  #   the callback method {#run} instead.
  # @param [Adapter Dependent] request the request object
  # @return [Array(Numeric,Hash,Array<String>)] a Rack-style response
  #   of status, headers, and body wrapped in an array.
  def call: (untyped request) -> [ Numeric, Hash[untyped, untyped], Array[String] ]
  # Subclass this method to implement a custom command. This method
  # should set the {#status} and {#body}, and optionally modify the
  # {#headers}. Note that +#status+ defaults to 200.
  #
  # @example A custom command
  #   class ErrorCommand < Base
  #     def run
  #       self.body = 'ERROR! The System is down!'
  #       self.status = 500
  #       self.headers['Conten-Type'] = 'text/plain'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @abstract
  # @return [void]
  def run: () -> void
  # Renders a specific object if provided, or a regular template rendering
  # if object is not provided.
  #
  # @todo This method is dependent on +#options+, it should be in {LibraryCommand}.
  # @param [CodeObjects::Base, nil] object calls {CodeObjects::Base#format} if
  #   an object is provided, or {Templates::Engine.render} if object is nil. Both
  #   receive +#options+ as an argument.
  # @return [String] the resulting output to display
  def render: (?YARD::CodeObjects::Base? object) -> String
  # Override this method to implement custom caching mechanisms for
  #
  # @example Caching to memory
  #   $memory_cache = {}
  #   def cache(data)
  #     $memory_cache[path] = data
  #   end
  # @param [String] data the data to cache
  # @return [String] the same cached data (for chaining)
  # @see StaticCaching
  def cache: (String data) -> String
  # Sets the body and headers for a 404 response. Does not modify the
  # body if already set.
  #
  # @return [void]
  def not_found: () -> void
  # Sets the headers and status code for a redirection to a given URL
  # @param [String] url the URL to redirect to
  # @raise [FinishRequest] causes the request to terminate.
  def redirect: (String url) -> untyped
  # Add a conservative cache control policy to reduce load on
  # requests served with "?1234567890" style timestamp query strings.
