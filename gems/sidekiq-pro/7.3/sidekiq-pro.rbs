  # Provides reliable queue processing via Redis' rpoplpush command.
  #
  # 1. retrieve the work while pushing it to our private queue for this process.
  # 2. process the work
  # 3. acknowledge the work by removing it from our private queue
  #
  # This process naturally has a drawback: if a job leads to the death of a Sidekiq
  # process we will recover and execute it over and over, killing the process each time. This
  # is known as a `poison pill`.
  #
  # super_fetch accounts for this two ways:
  #
  # 1. We run the recovery process intermittently, so we aren't killing processes rapidly.
  #    By default super_fetch runs the recovery logic at most once per hour.
  # 2. We track the number of times we've recovered a given JID. After N recoveries, we
  #    kill the job so it does not poison the system forever.
